# Descrtiption
I'm new with python and have decided to create this interesting project, because I want to practice and learn new framework, in this example - Selenium.
This scraper parses only two websites (https://currency.com/, https://dailyhodl.com/), but can parse more if you add more scrapers to scrapers folder in project directory. To connect python functions with web interface I used eel. It's really slow, but I will probably make it faster later. 
# Functionality

In this sreenshot there is a search input, where user writes some queries, if there more than one query, user should type them with space between each word. For example,
user want to search for dogecoin and litecoin, he should type in input: "dogecoin litecoin".
## Amount of articles 
On the left side of the search input, there is an input for amount of articles to return. User should type there the number between 1 to 9.
