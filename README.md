# Descrtiption
I'm new with python and have decided to create this interesting project, because I want to practice and learn new framework, in this example - Selenium.
This scraper parses only two websites (https://currency.com/, https://dailyhodl.com/), but can parse more if you add more scrapers to scrapers folder in project directory.
It's really slow, but can search for a lot of queries. To connect python functions with web interface I used eel.
